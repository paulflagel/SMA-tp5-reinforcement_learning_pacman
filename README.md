Project from Berkeley University initially in Python 2.7, I converted it to Python 3. Most of the codebase was already supplied, the goal of this project is to understand the code structure and to implement `valueIterationAgents.py` and `qlearningAgents.py`.



First, we will focus on a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and implement the value iteration algorithm, which computes values and q-values of each position of a maze with a reward on each cell.



## Get started

`python gridworld.py -a value -i 1000 -k 10`
